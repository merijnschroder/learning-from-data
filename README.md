## Setting Up The Environment
Make sure to have Python 3.7 installed on your machine.
You can check this by running

```ps
> python -V
Python 3.7.x
```

It is easiest to set up a virtual environment to run the code. 
On Windows, run the following:
```ps
> python -m venv .\.venv
> .\.venv\Scripts\activate
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

On Unix-based systems, run the following:
```bash
TODO
```

To install the dependencies, run
```ps
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
