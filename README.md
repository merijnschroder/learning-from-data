## Setting Up The Environment
Make sure to have Python 3.7 installed on your machine.
You can check this by running

```ps
> python -V
Python 3.7.x
```

It is easiest to set up a virtual environment to run the code. 
```ps
> python -m venv .venv
```
Make sure to activate the virtual environment.

To install the dependencies, run
```ps
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
